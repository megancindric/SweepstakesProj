Sweepstakes Project use of Dependency Injection

We utilized dependency injection within our Marketing Firm class.
This allows the user to select between a Queue or Stack Sweepstakes Manager, which will then
be passed into the constructor for the Marketing Firm, ensuring the correct manager is 
instantiated.
